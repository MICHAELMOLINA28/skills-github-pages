  <div><h2>About</h2><p>Hi, I’m Michael Molina! Originally from New York, I now call North Carolina home. Photography has been a major part of my life for over a decade, allowing me to capture meaningful moments, tell compelling stories, and preserve memories through my lens.

My journey began in the U.S. Navy, where I served as a Mass Communication Specialist. This role took me around the world, documenting military operations, humanitarian efforts, and everyday life in a variety of cultures. I had the privilege of photographing people, places, and events in numerous countries, each experience shaping my perspective and refining my skills. From high-paced action shots in operational settings to intimate portraits that highlight human resilience, my time in the Navy taught me the power of visual storytelling.

After my service, I continued to pursue photography professionally and personally, expanding my expertise in portraiture, landscapes, and documentary photography. I enjoy experimenting with different styles and techniques, always looking for new ways to bring stories to life. My work is driven by a passion for authenticity, emotion, and the art of visual communication.

Beyond photography, I have a background in digital media and website design, which allows me to present my work in creative and engaging ways. I’m always eager to learn new skills, refine my craft, and take on new challenges. Whether I’m behind the camera, editing an image, or designing a digital showcase, my goal is always the same—to create something impactful and memorable.
